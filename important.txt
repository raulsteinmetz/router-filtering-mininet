what we'll implement:

-- bad words


important commands:
- sudo python3 topo.py (starts mininet topology)
- iperf -c 8.8.8.8 -c 8888 (check package behaviour on 3 layer)
- python3 client-http.py on client side (requests for server)
    -- long -> argument that asks for big http responses, if not passed, the requests will be for short messages
    
- python3 server-http.py on server side (listens and respondes)
- python3 router.py --filter_badwords (router main with activated filter)
- python3 router.py (router main without filter)

if you are going to run it:
- make sure to install all pip3 packages with sudo cause mininet only runs on sudo
- download scapy with pip3
- download mininet from apt
- download curl from apt
- download mininet in pip3 also
